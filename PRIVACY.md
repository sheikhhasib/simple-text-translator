# Privacy Policy

**Simple Text Translator**

This Chrome extension is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains what data the extension collects, how it's used, and your rights regarding that data.

## Data Collection

Simple Text Translator does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data to external servers or third parties.

## Local Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API:

- Language preferences and settings
- Translation history (text you've translated)
- Custom language lists

## Data Usage

The extension stores the following types of data locally:

1. **Translation History**:
   - Source text that you translate
   - Translated text results
   - Source and target language codes
   - Timestamps of translations
   - Favorite status of translations
   - Translation confidence scores (when available)

2. **User Preferences**:
   - Selected source and target languages
   - Enabled/disabled status of the extension
   - Custom language lists for the popup interface

3. **Interface Settings**:
   - Tab preferences in the popup
   - Search history terms

All this data is stored locally in your browser and is never transmitted to any external servers except for the text that needs to be translated through the MyMemory API.

## Text Translation

When you use the translation feature:

- Selected text is sent directly to the MyMemory API for translation
- No personal identification information is sent with the translation requests
- Translation results are displayed locally in your browser
- Text is not stored on our servers or shared with third parties beyond the API request

## Remote Code

The extension does not load or execute any remote code. All extension functionality is contained within the locally installed files. Translation requests are sent to the MyMemory API service, but this is data transmission for translation purposes, not code execution.

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- `storage`: To save your language preferences and translation history
- `tabs`: To interact with web pages for translation
- `contextMenus`: To provide right-click translation options
- `host_permissions`: To access web pages for translation functionality

## Third-Party Services

The extension uses the MyMemory API for translation services. Please refer to their privacy policy for information on how they handle data: https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/usagelimits.php

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Use the extension without providing personal information
- Clear your translation history at any time through the extension interface
- Uninstall the extension at any time to remove all locally stored data

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
