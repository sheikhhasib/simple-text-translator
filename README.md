## Chrome Built-in Translator API (Google Translate)

This extension supports Chrome's built-in Translator API, which provides offline translation capabilities using Google's AI models. This feature offers several advantages:

### Benefits:
*   **Offline Translation:** Translate text without an internet connection
*   **Privacy:** Translations are processed locally on your device
*   **Speed:** Faster translations as there's no network latency
*   **Reliability:** No dependency on external API availability or rate limits

### Requirements:
*   Google Chrome version 138 or higher
*   Device with sufficient storage for language models (models are downloaded automatically when first used)

### Language Support:
The Chrome Built-in Translator API supports over 100 languages, including:
*   English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian
*   Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese, Korean
*   Arabic, Hindi, Bengali, Turkish, Dutch, Swedish, Polish
*   And many more languages

### How It Works:
1. When you select the Chrome Built-in Translator API option, the extension will automatically download the required language models
2. Models are downloaded in the background and stored locally on your device
3. Subsequent translations are processed instantly without network requests
4. Language models are updated automatically with Chrome updates

### Limitations:
*   Initial download of language models may take some time depending on your connection
*   Requires Chrome 138 or higher
*   Language models consume device storage space

## Troubleshooting

* **Translations not appearing**: Ensure the extension is enabled in the popup
* **API errors**: Check your internet connection; the MyMemory API might be temporarily unavailable
* **Languages not saving**: Try refreshing the page after changing language preferences
* **Chrome Built-in Translator not available**: This feature requires Chrome version 138 or higher
* **Offline translations not working**: Ensure language models have been downloaded (connect to internet first)

## Privacy
This extension does not collect or store any personal data. Translations are performed using either the MyMemory API or Chrome's built-in Translator API, and no text is stored on our servers. All settings and history are stored locally in your browser.

When using Chrome's built-in Translator API:
* Translations are processed locally on your device
* No text is sent to external servers
* Language models are stored locally on your device

## Translation API

This extension supports multiple translation APIs:
1. **MyMemory API**: A free, public API for online translations
2. **Chrome Built-in Translator API**: Offline translation using Chrome's built-in AI models (requires Chrome 138+)
